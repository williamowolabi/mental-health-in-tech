- Clean demographic fields (age, gender)
- Standardize Yes/No responses
- Handle missing values
- Prepare the data for future modeling


 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (preprocessing only)

 No Predictions Yet
This version only includes:
- Data loading
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory analysis
- Preparing features

 Next Steps
- Train ML models
- Feature engineering
